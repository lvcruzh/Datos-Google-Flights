# Google Flights Web Scraping and Data Mining

This repository focuses on web scraping and data mining from the [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) website using R Selenium.

**Prerequisites:**

Before getting started, make sure to load the following R packages:

- R Selenium
- dplyr
- rebus
- stringr
- readxl

**Usage:**

Begin with the 'web-scraping.R' file, adjusting the date as needed.
After running the script, execute the second R file ('data-mining.R) to generate a structured database that visually represents all flight information. Customize it based on your requirements.

**Note:**

- Data processing may encounter specific errors during execution.
- Six weeks' worth of obtained data are included for reference. Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your needs.
